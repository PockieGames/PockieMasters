# PockieMasters

[WIP] An online turn-based Mobile Game made with Cocos Creator.

# Installation

Clone the repository and install all dependencies:

`cd .\Client && npm install` then `cd .\Server && npm install`

Install tsrpc-cli globally:

`npm install -g tsrpc-cli`

Then just run the server once: 

`npm run dev` (other commands will follow as this project progresses)

The shared folder will automatically be symlinked to the client
